#this is a code comment. The program can't read it
#it's just a way to make notes as you code! :)


print "hello world"
#this line prints "hello world"

playerName = raw_input("what is your first name kind sir? ")
#this line saves the user's input to the variable playerName
# note you could make player name any work so potato = raw_input("What is your name") is valid code too!

location = raw_input("Where do you live? ")


print playerName + " is your name and you live at " + location
#concatenate all of these variables together into one sentence
