* Final Exam - 40% of the final grade The homework assignments are required and will consist of programming assignments.

###Labs
Each week there will be a lab assignment here in a folder called lab

Video documentation is suitable for turning in physical assignments 

All code must be documented on github and your github repo most be mailed to the instructor within a week of the start of the term
