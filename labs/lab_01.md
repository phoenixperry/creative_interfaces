##### Exercise_01
Buy a raspberry pi and set up ssh, vnc, sftp and wifi. Login remotely from your laptop or test top and from the command line run a python application you create that prints out 
"Hello World." 

#####Exercise_02
Create an application that does the following: 
Ask the user how many years old they are. 
Ask the user months until their birthday. 
Compute how many days old they are and print it out as a string. Average 30 days in each month for ease. 

Sample output: 

```You are 9125 days old```

Use sftp to put this code on your pi from your computer. 

Use ssh to login to your pi and run this code remotely from the command line.
